Core Lesson feature requires games with stockfish move_evaluations containing mistake_type fields to show behavioral patterns. Current games have incomplete stockfish data (accuracy=0, move_evaluations empty), so Core Lesson shows 'Game not yet analyzed with engine.' This is expected behavior - infrastructure is working.",
