<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user requested a complete overhaul of the coaching system, replacing the old Focus and Coach pages with a new, unified Training page. This system evolved through several iterations to become a highly personalized, adaptive training journey. The core features include:
1.  **Adaptive Training Journey:** A dynamic, multi-tier, rating-adaptive training path. The system automatically places users in a skill tier (e.g., Structure Tier: 1000-1400 Rating) and guides them through a series of phases (e.g., Opening Principles).
2.  **Automatic Graduation:** The system automatically graduates the user to the next phase when they meet specific, measurable goals, which now include achieving a streak of clean games.
3.  **AI-Powered Reflection & Explanation:** The system uses a  pipeline to provide commentary on chess mistakes. This ensures GPT only provides natural language explanations based on factual analysis from the Stockfish engine and a Python-based deterministic layer, preventing AI hallucinations.
4.  **Interactive UI:** The frontend provides a feature-rich interface for users to see their progress, analyze mistakes on an interactive board, and receive theoretical guidance for their current training phase.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
- A sophisticated backend service () that manages the entire adaptive training journey. It now incorporates a robust pipeline using Stockfish for chess analysis, a deterministic layer () to classify mistakes, and an LLM for generating commentary.
- A comprehensive but monolithic frontend page () that displays the user's tier, phase, progress, streak-based graduation criteria, and phase-specific theory.
- An Explain feature that provides accurate, AI-powered explanations for why a suggested move is better, based on the  architecture.
- The user's board is oriented based on their color in the game, and arrows highlight the better move.
- An incomplete migration from  to the Lichess  library is in progress. A new  component has been created, but its integration into  is unfinished and has left the board non-functional.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was working on a user request to replace the existing  component with the more feature-rich Lichess  library (). The agent created a new wrapper component  and started refactoring  to use it, but the work is incomplete and has broken the chessboard display.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** frontend testing agent
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: The chessboard is broken due to an incomplete migration to the Lichess  library. (P0)**

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1:**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** A new  component was created. The  component was partially refactored to use this new component, but the implementation was not finished, resulting in a broken UI.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Resume work in .
        2.  Correctly import and render the new  component.
        3.  Ensure all necessary props (, , ,  callback) are correctly passed from  to .
        4.  Verify that  correctly uses the refactored  and that the Lichess board renders with the correct orientation and arrows.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a user-explicit request to improve the UI/UX with a better chessboard. Fixing it will resolve the currently broken UI and fulfill the user's requirement.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete the migration from  to Lichess . (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** Finish refactoring  to correctly use the new  component.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The application will use the Lichess  board, fulfilling a direct user request for a more polished and feature-rich interface.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **P1: Code Cleanup:** Delete obsolete files to reduce technical debt: , , , and .
    -   **P1: Componentize :** Break down the monolithic  file (over 1300 lines) into smaller, manageable components like , , and .
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P2: Drill Generation Logic:** Implement the backend service to generate contextual drills based on the user's active phase.
    -   **P3: Advanced User Thoughts Analysis:** Build a more advanced model on the collected reflection data for deeper personalization.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Fixed AI Hallucination:** Re-architected the move explanation feature to use a  pipeline. GPT is now only responsible for commentary on factual analysis provided by Stockfish and the existing  module, solving a critical bug where the AI provided incorrect chess advice.
-   **Resolved Duplicate Logic:** Removed a redundant, newly created  class and refactored the code to use the pre-existing and more powerful  service.
-   **Implemented Streak-Based Graduation:** Changed the graduation criteria from a simple count of clean games to requiring a **streak** of consecutive clean games, making progression more meaningful.
-   **Fixed Example Position Relevancy:** Refined the logic to filter out tactical puzzles (like mate-in-one) from phases focused on strategic concepts (like Pawn Structure), making examples more relevant.
-   **Added Board Interactivity:** The board now orients based on the user's color and displays arrows to indicate the played move vs. the better move.
-   **Improved UI Clarity:** Removed the confusing Training Areas and Cost metrics, simplifying the UI to focus on the user's journey. Stats for Clean Games and performance trends were also reworded to be more understandable.
-   **Added In-App Theory:** Implemented a Phase Theory section that provides users with educational content related to their current training phase.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Tactics Audit Data Inconsistency:** A legacy backend issue where tactic blunders were sometimes missed. This has not been re-evaluated.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **3-Layer Analysis Architecture:** A critical pattern of  to ensure domain-specific accuracy and prevent AI hallucination.
-   **Streak-Based Progression:** Using a series of consecutive successes as a metric for mastery and graduation.
-   **React Component Wrapping:** Creating a React component () to wrap and manage a non-React library ().

**key DB schema**
-   No changes made to the database schema in this session.

**changes in tech stack**
-   **** is being replaced with **** for the frontend chessboard display.

**All files of reference**
-   
-    (Currently broken)
-    (New)
-   
-   

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **:** The refactoring to use  is incomplete and must be finished.
-   **:** This file is extremely large and needs to be broken down into smaller, focused components.
-   **Obsolete Code:** Deprecated files (, , ) are still in the codebase and should be deleted.

**key api endpoints**
-   : This endpoint was significantly reworked to use the new  pipeline for generating explanations.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **The immediate priority is to fix the broken chessboard.** The migration to the Lichess  library was left half-finished. Resume work in .
-   **Always check for existing code before implementing new features.** A significant amount of time and user tokens were wasted by recreating a deterministic analysis layer () when a comprehensive one () already existed. Use  and .:
Adjust loop. It generates a Round

./tests:
__init__.py to explore the codebase first.
-   **Adhere to the 3-layer architecture ()** for all chess-related analysis. The user is technically savvy and will reject solutions where the LLM is responsible for chess logic.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-    (Updated)

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
-   **User:** Asked why a new deterministic class was built when one already existed. - **RESOLVED**
-   **User:** Complained about the wasted tokens from the duplicate work. - **ADDRESSED**
-   **User:** Instructed the agent to always check for existing code in the future. - **ACKNOWLEDGED**
-   **User:** Asked to see their color, have arrows on the board, and confirmed they wanted the Lichess board. - **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED** (arrows/color done on old board).
-   **User:** Asked if the Lichess board was being used. - **ANSWERED** (No).
-   **User:** Explicitly instructed the agent to switch to the Lichess board (). - **IN PROGRESS** (This is the current broken task).

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The primary chessboard UI is non-functional due to the incomplete migration to .
-   **Mocked:** 

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Stockfish:** Chess engine used for analysis (via ).
-   **:** The library being replaced.
-   **:** The Lichess chessboard library being integrated.
-   ** (GPT-4o-mini):** Used for generating commentary via Emergent LLM Key.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None
-   **Known regressions:** The entire chessboard feature is currently non-functional.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   Use the Dev Login button on the landing page.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent forgot to search the codebase for an existing deterministic layer () before building a new one from scratch.
-   The agent did not complete the migration to the Lichess  board, leaving the UI in a broken state before finishing.</analysis>
