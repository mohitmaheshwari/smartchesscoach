Coach Play Routes
=================

Handles the "Play with Coach" feature including:
- Starting/ending coach play sessions
- Making moves and getting coach responses
- Real-time feedback and evaluation
- Endgame lessons
- Opening teaching integration

NOTE: This is the first phase of refactoring. The main routes are still in server.py
but will be progressively moved here.

Routes to be migrated from server.py:
- POST /coach/play/start (line ~8778)
- POST /coach/play/move (line ~8935)
- GET /coach/play/messages/{session_id} (line ~9696)
- POST /coach/play/reflect (line ~9767)
- POST /coach/play/chat (line ~9855)
- POST /coach/play/evaluate (line ~9969)
- POST /coach/play/move/confirm (line ~10080)
- GET /coach/play/state/{session_id} (line ~10228)
- GET /coach/play/feedback/{session_id} (line ~10260)
- POST /coach/play/end (line ~10291)
- POST /coach/play/analysis (line ~10341)
- GET /coach/play/active (line ~10466)
- GET /coach/play/history (line ~10486)
- GET /coach/play/identity (line ~10520)
- GET /coach/play/cpr/history (line ~10555)
- GET /coach/play/behaviors/{session_id} (line ~10582)

- POST /coach/play/endgame/move (line ~10740)
- GET /coach/play/opening-plan (line ~11072)
- POST /coach/play/teaching/start (line ~11154)
- POST /coach/play/teaching/move (line ~11197)
- POST /coach/play/teaching/exit (line ~11242)
- POST /coach/play/teaching/skip (line ~11281)
