"""
caption_pipeline — single source of truth for the per-move caption brain.

Built per Mohit + reviewer agreement 2026-05-25 + 2026-05-26:
  - "build a central layer that gets shared by both pwc and review"
  - "extract a single build_move_teaching_decision(...) pipeline that
     returns caption + suppression mutations + trap state mutations +
     principle firing + visual annotations + coaching metadata"
  - "shared logic is good. Shared performance profile is not
     automatically good." Benchmark before extraction confirmed full
     V5 brain runs 3.5ms p50 / 6.4ms p99 per move — well within PWC's
     400-700ms budget. No fast/full mode flag required.

CONTRACT (Mohit-locked semantic-product split, not procedural):

  MoveInputs (immutable, pure-function inputs the function receives)
  CrossMoveState (mutable state threaded across moves in a session/game)
  MoveTeachingDecision (the complete teaching product for ONE move)

  build_move_teaching_decision(inputs, state) → (decision, new_state)

Both callers — game_decryption_v5_service (batch game review) AND
live_v5_teaching (live PWC coaching) — become thin shims around this
function. Any future detector, cue rewrite, severity tweak, or
softening change goes in ONE place and reaches both surfaces.

EXTRACTION CONTRACT (behavior preservation):
  - Snapshot 'baseline_v99' captured pre-extraction (scripts/snapshot_captions.py)
  - Regen-diff post-extraction MUST be byte-identical for:
      caption, rule_name, severity, severity_practical, severity_canonical,
      principle_id_used, shape_pattern_id, caption_tier,
      caption_arrows, caption_highlight_squares, shape_pattern_targets
  - silent_count must be identical (silence is sacred per Mohit 2026-05-25)
  - pytest at the boundary (~20 canonical positions from v83-v99 fixes)
    guards against future regression

MIGRATION STATUS (2026-05-26):
  [in progress] Step 1: dataclasses + skeleton (this file)
  [pending] Step 2: extract severity-classification block, verify zero diff
  [pending] Step 3: extract caption_facts wiring (lost_defender_lead, etc.)
  [pending] Step 4: extract opp punishment / positional detection
  [pending] Step 5: extract simulate_* detectors
  [pending] Step 6: extract trap recognition
  [pending] Step 7: extract shape pattern selection
  [pending] Step 8: extract board state describer
  [pending] Step 9: extract render + promotion ladder dispatch
  [pending] Step 10: wire PWC to use this module
  [pending] Step 11: retire shared_coaching_v5.MoveSeverity +
