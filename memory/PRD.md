# Chess Coaching Application - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Create a hyper-personalized, data-driven chess coaching application that functions as a human-like AI coach with Socratic-style, contextual feedback tailored to the user's playstyle.

## What's Been Implemented

### Core Features
- **Play with Coach**: Move-by-move coaching during opening phase (every move gets commentary)
- **Game Analysis Lab**: 5-tab structure (Summary, Moments, Ideas, Habits, Memory)
- **Moments Tab**: Interactive training loop (Intro → Thinking → Try Move → Reveal → Reflection → Lesson)
- **Turning Point Detection**: v4 logic, correctly handles user-only move evaluations
- **Blind Spots**: Homepage widget showing recurring mistake patterns
- **Explain Move**: Expandable explanations for turning points and biggest blunders
- **Opening Teaching**: Rich teaching moments for Queen's Gambit, Italian, London, etc.

## Prioritized Backlog

### P1 - Next
- [ ] Fix Onboarding/Navigation flow (unreliable Demo Mode)
- [ ] Add "What You Did Well" section to Summary (celebrate good moves)
- [ ] Enrich more opening plans with teaching_moments (Italian, Sicilian, etc.)
- [ ] Add trap detection for more openings in move_by_move_coach.py

### P2 - Backlog
- [ ] Lesson flow bug verification (Fried Liver Attack)
- [ ] Integrate MistakeFingerprint + ReinforcementEngine
- [ ] Positive pattern tracking on homepage (strengths alongside blind spots)
- [ ] Shareable "Chess DNA" report
- [ ] Enhanced "Ask Coach" prompts

## Testing Status
- All features tested: iterations 120, 121, 122 (all passed)
- Test files: `/app/backend/tests/test_*.py`

## Key Technical Notes
- `move_evaluations` only contains USER's moves (not both sides)
- `get_opening_by_moves` returns `OpeningPlan` dataclass, use `getattr()` not `.get()`
- User data in `test_database`, DEV_USER_ID=user_4dad2b14e380
- Coach messages stored in `coach_messages` collection with trigger="opening_teaching"
